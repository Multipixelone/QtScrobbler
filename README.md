# Qt Scrobbler

This is a clone of the famous sourceforge-project (from Robert Keevil, 2010 (?)); refreshed and slightly improved.

QTScrobbler ships both GUI and cli versions and requires Qt >= 5.5

Optional MTP support requires _libmtp-dev_ and _pkg-config_
(or the Windows 7 SDK if using MS Visual C++)

# How to compile?

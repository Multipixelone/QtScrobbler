.SH SYNOPSIS
.B scrobbler
.RI [ options ]
.br
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B scrobbler
is a program to submit information about tracks which have been listened to
from a portable music player to last.fm (previously known as Audioscrobbler),
libre.fm and/or a custom site of your choice.
.B scrobbler
can read this information from .scrobbler.log files (i.e. produced by the
open Rockbox firmware), from iPod databases, or from devices that use MTP
(aka Plays for Sure).
In addition to this,
.B scrobbler
can adjust the date/time information relating to when the track was listened
to before uploading.  This can be useful if your device is set to a different
timezone to the machine you upload from.

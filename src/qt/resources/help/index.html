QTScrobbler is a tool to upload information about the tracks you have
played from your Digital Audio Player (DAP) to your last.fm (or
libre.fm) account. It is able to gather this information from Apple
iPods, DAPs running the Rockbox replacement firmware, or MTP devices
(aka PlaysForSure). </p>

      <u><strong>General Settings</strong></u>
     <br />
      <br />
      <img src=":/images/settings_general.png" /><br />
      <br />
      <strong>Automatically open log</strong>:
once you have successfully submitted this will remember the last mount
point of your DAP and attempt to use it again the next time you click
Open. <br />
      <br />
      <strong>Auto-delete Apple Playcount</strong>:
(iTunes DB only) third party software for syncing with iPods (instead
of iTunes) does not always delete the "Play Counts" file - selecting
this option will remove the file for you on a successful submission.
This will prevent the same tracks from reappearing again and again. <br />
      <br />
      <strong>Display time as UTC</strong>: Enabling
this will display all times in the GUI as UTC (aka GMT), otherwise they
will be displayed in your local timezone (including any overrides set
in the Timezone tab). <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      <u><strong>Sites</strong></u>
      <br />
      <br />
      <img src=":/images/settings_sites.png" /><br />
      <br />
Here you can enable the upload of track information to one or more of
last.fm, libre.fm and a custom site. last.fm and libre.fm have their
hostname information hard-coded, whilst the custom site is available
for you to set as required. <br />
      <br />
      <strong>Username</strong> and <strong>Password</strong> are your 
login for the site in question. The password is saved in an encrypted 
form. <strong>Enabled</strong> allows you to choose which sites to upload 
to.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
      <u><strong>Proxy Settings</strong></u>
      <br />
      <br />
      <img src=":/images/settings_proxy.png" /><br />
      <br />
Here you can set the Host and Port details for a HTTP proxy. You can
also optionally specify Username &amp; Password authentication if
required. N.B. the proxy Username &amp; Password are stored as plain
text! <br />
      <br />
      <br />
      <u><strong>Timezone Settings</strong></u>
      <br />
      <br />
      <img src=":/images/settings_timezone.png" /><br />
     <br />
      <br />
This displays the automatically detected timezone settings. If this is
incorrect, or if your DAP is using different settings, set the manual
override. <br />
   </p>
    <p>
     <u><strong>Using QTScrobbler</strong></u>
      <br />
      <br />Make sure your DAP is connected to your PC and properly 
mounted, and then select <strong>Open .scrobbler.log</strong> if you 
are using Rockbox, <strong>Open iTunesDB</strong> if you are using the 
iPod firmware, or <strong>Open MTP</strong> to connect to your MTP 
device.  For the first two options this will cause an open dialogue to 
appear - select the <em>root</em> folder for your DAP, i.e. on Windows 
the drive letter that has been assigned, or on Linux the mount point 
such as <span class="mono">/media/ipod</span>.
      <br />
      <br />
This will load the track information into the main grid view - here you
can correct entries by double clicking on the individual cells, or
remove one or more entries using the <strong>Delete selected item</strong> button.
      <br />
      <br />
      It is also possible to edit date all tracks were listened to at 
once using the <strong>Recalc Date/Time</strong> button.  The end 
timestamp can be adjusted by changing the spincontrol in the bottom 
right corner.  N.B. when opening a <span class="mono">.scrobbler-timeless.log</span> 
file from a Rockbox target that lacks a clock, or when using a MTP 
device, this step is taken automatically.
      <br />
      <br />
      Once you are happy that all the track information is how it should 
be it's time to <strong>Submit</strong> them!
      <br />
